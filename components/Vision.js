          We denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
          by pleasure of the moment, blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
          the pain and trouble. Pleasure of the moment, blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
          the pain and trouble. Pleasure of the moment, blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
          the pain and trouble.
