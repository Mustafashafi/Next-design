        and episodic 'Sick care' into a predictive, preventive, personalized, 
        continuously accessible, and affordable 'healthcare' for fuller and longer lives for all.
         It means changing today’s healthcare, which usually helps people after they get sick, 
         into a system that predicts, prevents, and monitors health problems early — 
         making healthcare more personalized, affordable, and always available 
         so everyone can live healthier and longer lives."
